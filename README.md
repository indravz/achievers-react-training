# Initial React App Setup

## Steps to Clean Up and Configure Your React App

1. **Remove Extra Files**:
   - Delete all files and folders created by `npx create-react-app`, except for `public/index.html` and `src/index.js`.

2. **Remove Unused References**:
   - In `src/index.js`, remove any references to components that were deleted.

3. **Create a New Module**:
   - Create a new file named `App.js` in the `src` directory.
   - Use the following command to create the component:
     ```bash
     rfc
     ```
   - This will create a new React functional component named `App`.

4. **Update `index.js`**:
   - Import the `App` component in `src/index.js` and render it:
     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
     import App from './App';

     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
     ```

5. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run the following command to build and start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will open your React app in the browser.

## Summary
You have successfully cleaned up your React app setup and created a new module called `App`. Enjoy building your application!
